\title{
Function to find stopping boundaries for a 2- or 3-stage (step-down) multiple-comparisons-with-control test.
}

\description{
The function determines stopping boundaries for all intersection hypothesis tests in a multi-arm multi-stage study, given the amount of alpha (familywise error rate) to be spent at each analysis.
}

\usage{
step_down_mams(nMat=matrix(c(10, 20), now=2, ncol=4),
               alpha_star=c(0.01, 0.025), lb=0,
               selection="all_promising")
}

\arguments{
  \item{nMat}{Matrix containing the cumulative sample sizes in each treatment arm (columns: control, trt 1, ..., trt K), at each analysis (rows). The number of analyses must be either 2 or 3 (default=matrix(c(10, 20), nrow=2, ncol=4)).}
  \item{alpha_star}{Cumulative familywise error rate to be spent at each analysis (default=c(0.01, 0.025)).}
  \item{lb}{Fixed lower boundary (default=0).}
  \item{selection}{How are treatments selected for the next stage? Using the default "all_promising" method, all treatments with a test statistic exceeding the lower boundary are taken forward to the next stage. If "select_best", only the treatment with the largest statistic may be selected for future stages. (default="all_promising").}
}

\details{
The function implements the methods described in Magirr et al. (2014) to find individual boundaries for all intersection hypotheses.
}

\value{
An object of the class MAMS.step_down containing the following components: \cr 
  \item{l}{Lower boundaries. } 
  \item{u}{Upper boundaries.}
  \item{nMat}{Cumulative sample sizes on each treatment arm.}
  \item{K}{Number of experimental treatments.}
  \item{J}{Number of stages in the trial.}
  \item{alpha_star}{Cumulative familywise error rate spent at each analysis.}
  \item{selection}{Pre-specified method of treatment selection.}
  \item{z_scores}{A list containing the observed test statistics at analyses so far (at the design stage this is NULL).}
  \item{selected_trts}{A list containing the treatments selected for each stage.}
